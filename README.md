# Upela

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

##Development
Point current directory to the root of cloned sources and run:

```
#!sh
npm install && bower install
```
These two command install application dependencies (front-end and development). You should run it *every time* when dependency list changes.

You can now run
```
#!sh
grunt serve
```
to start local web server. The application is available in http://localhost:9000
Once you change any file in the /app folder the page in the browser would automatically reload.


## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
